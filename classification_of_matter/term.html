Matter exists in different states, primarily solid, liquid, and gas, each with distinct physical properties. The state of matter depends on factors like temperature and pressure, which influence how the particles within the matter interact and move. In solids, particles are closely packed in a fixed arrangement, in liquids they are more loosely connected and can flow, and in gases, they are spread out and move freely. Matter can also undergo physical and chemical changes, transforming from one form to another while adhering to the law of conservation of mass, which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a closed system.",

This technique effectively separates the components because each liquid in the mixture will boil at a different temperature. For example, distillation can be used to purify water by separating it from impurities or to separate different alcohols in the production of spirits. The process relies on the principle that different substances have different boiling points, allowing them to be separated when heated and cooled.",

The filter allows the fluid to pass through while trapping the solid particles on its surface or within its porous structure. This technique is commonly used to purify liquids or gases by removing impurities. For example, in a coffee maker, filtration separates coffee grounds from the brewed liquid. In water treatment, filtration removes suspended solids and contaminants from water.
