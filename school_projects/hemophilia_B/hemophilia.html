        <h2 style="color: black; padding-top: 20px; font-size: 30px;"><b><u>Explanation of Hemophilia B:</u></b></h2>
        <br>
        <p>Hemophilia B is classified as a genetic disorder caused by a gene mutation that affects the blood's ability
            to clot, leading to excessive bleeding and other related complications. It is a sex-linked recessive trait.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(82, 80, 80); padding-top: 20px; font-size: 25px;"><b>Type of Mutation:</b></h3>
        <br>
        <p>Hemophilia B is caused by a mutation in the F9 gene (factor IX) on the X chromosome. Since the disorder is
            located on the X chromosome males are more likely to be affected by the disease than women who are more
            likely to be carriers. Using the image below, you can see all combinations that can be made where the man is
            affected and the woman is a carrier.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>Using the image above you can see that there are many combinations that can be made with Hemophilia B. Since
            men only have one X chromosome, it is easier for them to be born with Hemophilia B. Below are three cross
            where at least one offspring will be affected by or be a carrier of Hemophilia B.</p>

                <p class="scrolling-text">Hemophilia B is a rare genetic bleeding disorder which causes deficiency in
                    clotting, which in turn causes
                    prolonged bleeding and difficulty in forming blood clots. Common symptoms of Hemophilia B include
                    easy
                    bruising, excessive bleeding from minor cuts or injuries, prolonged bleeding after surgery or dental
                    procedures, and sudden bleeding into joints, muscles, or other tissues. People with hemophilia B may
                    also
                    experience symptoms such as nosebleeds, blood in urine or feces, and, in severe cases, potentially
                    life-threatening internal bleeding.</p>

                Protein Function for Affected Gene:</b>
        </h2>
        <p>With advancements in treatment, individuals with Hemophilia B can live longer lives, though severe cases can
            still pose risks of life-threatening bleeding episodes. Reproduction in families affected by Hemophilia B
            requires careful consideration due to its genetic inheritance pattern. Males with Hemophilia B can pass the
            affected gene to their daughters, who become carriers, but not to their sons. Genetic counseling plays a
            crucial role in family planning for individuals with Hemophilia B and their carriers, providing guidance on
            risk assessment and available options for managing the condition across generations. In Hemophilia B,
            mutations in the F9 gene impair the production of clotting factor IX, a critical protein in the blood
            clotting process. With reduced or absent levels of functional factor IX, blood clot formation is
            compromised, leading to bleeding issues.
        </p>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(82, 80, 80); padding-top: 20px; font-size: 25px;"><b>Impact on the Homeostasis of the
                Body</b></h2>
        <p>Hemophilia B disrupts the body's balance by interfering with its ability to clot blood effectively. This
            means that even minor cuts or injuries can lead to prolonged bleeding, making it challenging for the body to
            heal properly. As a result, individuals with Hemophilia B are at a higher risk of experiencing complications
            like joint bleeds or internal bleeding, which can be serious and even life-threatening if not promptly
            addressed. While treatments like clotting factor replacement therapy can help manage Hemophilia B,
            maintaining a careful watch for signs of bleeding and seeking medical attention when necessary are essential
            for maintaining stability and well-being.</p>
